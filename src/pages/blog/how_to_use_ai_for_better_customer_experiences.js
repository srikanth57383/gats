                  Among the many companies exploring the uses of artificial
                  intelligence, there is one surprisingly unique group;
                  companies that actually transform customer experiences using
                  AI. How do they do it? Let us learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For many companies, especially for the ones that perceived
                  customer experience to be a marketing responsibility, the
                  COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded the moments of truth. As more
                  and more consumers started purchasing goods and services
                  online, digital channels have become the hotspots of customer
                  experience. Few businesses that understood the role of
                  artificial intelligence in customer experience, took up the
                  transformation responsibility and turned adversity into
                  advantage.

                <p>
                  A leading e-commerce company in the US started out with a
                  simple philosophy of modernizing the complete customer journey
                  experience. With a focus to deliver a sequence of interactions
                  to the customers that end on a positive note and unite the
                  purpose of the company, the executives took a decision to
                  adopt AI at scale. A multidisciplinary team including the
                  Chief Data Officer (CDO)representing the analytics team, CTO
                  representing the engineering, and CMO concentrating on
                  marketing, began a journey of customer experience
                  transformation leveraging artificial intelligence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In 6 months, the results were worth looking at. The company
                    had:
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enabled complete automation of marketing workflows based on
                    key indicators from analytics
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Identified the most important customer journeys that helped
                    retain 40% of existing users
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Reduced sales overheads on customer support by 35% using
                    automation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Drove 20% new users from new categories of the target
                    audience
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Such early economic wins are delivering momentum for the
                  continuous transformation of customer experience using
                  artificial intelligence. With the lessons learned from such
                  success stories, artificial intelligence can be adopted to
                  improve customer experience easier. The immediate challenge
                  for companies will be how to structure the customer experience
                  transformation, as well as figuring out the important uses of
                  artificial intelligence across the pillars of customer
                  experience. We have identified, across all industries, that
                  customer experience transformation is usually based on 3 key
                  pillars: personalization, customer service, and
                  marketing-sales alignment.
                </p>
                <h3>Improving marketing personalization using AI</h3>
                <p>
                  Using AI, companies can execute behavioral psychology
                  initiatives that scan the data from multiple sources to assign
                  a priority score to the leads and existing users. Machine
                  learning algorithms can be used by companies to create
                  personalized categories of customer segments in the form of
                  data sets that can be further organized on any marketing
                  automation platform for advertising. For instance, one
                  OTTplatform tailored broadcasting playlists based on
                  customer’s watching habits that discovered at least100 new
                  data sets for the target audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of marketing personalization, customer experience
                  can be transformed using AI in multiple ways. Some important
                  ways, in both the B2C and B2B industries, however, remain the
                  same. Artificial intelligence can be used to tweak
                  micro-elements of content to personalize a host of
                  communications with a customer. In another case, AI is also
                  helping companies retarget and remarket to bounced users on
                  multiple digital channels with consistent messaging, Such
                  customer experience transformations using artificial
                  intelligence usually analyses user behavior to target only
                  qualified leads that convert easily. Finally, marketing
                  personalization, powered by artificial intelligence, has also
                  been noticed in contextual notifications for users based on
                  real-time events.

                <h3>Enhance customer service using AI</h3>

                <p>
                  Customers today don’t hesitate to flaunt their power.
                  Customers are demanding seamless service, right now, without
                  much intervention. In such times, traditional customer support
                  isn’t working. And customer service is a major part of the
                  customer experience scoresheet, automated resolution of
                  customer tickets is the only way out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To that end, artificial intelligence is playing a key role in
                  automating many customer touchpoints that decrease time to
                  resolution and increase customer satisfaction as a result. A
                  few companies, for example, are making use of AI-based
                  chatbots to respond to customer queries. Over time and across
                  industries, AI-based virtual assistants are also serving the
                  need for customer experience transformation. Here are a few
                  use cases every company can deliver to enhance customer
                  service using AI:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Augmenting and automating messaging on chatbots</li>
                  <li>Sorting and routing support inquiries</li>
                  <li>
                    Reducing average ticket handling time with response content
                    templates
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Automating customer surveys after product/service delivery
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Virtual assistant integrations such as Amazon Alexa or
                    Google Assistant
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Marketing sales alignment using AI</h3>
                <p>
                  In the new normal, it is imperative for companies to be
                  proactive and nimble when it comes to anticipating customer
                  expectations and delivering on their needs and desires. It’s
                  mostly about bridging the gap between marketing and sales.
                  Apparently, now is the time for companies to invest in data,
                  advanced analytics, and digital platforms to bring a cohesive
                  alignment between their marketing and sales functions.
                  However, the alignment can only be made possible with the help
                  of an AI-based recommendation engine that will collect
                  marketing data, analyze, and uncover novel opportunities for
                  sales. Let’s look at how one company brought synchrony between
                  its marketing and sales and transformed its customer
                  experience using AI
                </p>
                <p>
                  One European airline, for instance, developed an AI-based
                  proprietary platform to predict customers’flying needs based
                  on occasions across the globe. The platform pushed predictive
                  analytics from near real-time events taking place in its
                  target geographies. Some of the most successful use cases that
                  the recommendations delivered were holidays, destination
                  marriages, and corporate bookings. By acting based on these
                  insights, the airline’s company was better able to predict
                  customer segments and offer dynamic pricing that resulted in
                  increased conversion. Ultimately, the company could transform
                  the customer experiences using AI to an extent that it
                  delivered a 300% rise in customer satisfaction scores.

                    Companies can’t stand out in the crowd by setting customer
                    experience initiatives and forgetting them. Customer
                    expectations are evolving with each passing day and
                    ultra-modern intelligence can only monitor comprehensive
                    marketing trends to advise better. More than ever before,
                    this is the time for companies to adopt AI and respond
