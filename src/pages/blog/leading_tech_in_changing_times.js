                  The luxury of time now seems to disappear completely, and
                  businesses must scale their digital transformation initiatives
                  to keep pace during these changing times. Here’s how to lead
                  tech during the post-pandemic era and beyond.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Digital technology has been challenging traditional firms and
                  propelling companies to pursue large-scale transformation
                  efforts over a period of 3 to 5 years. However, as the
                  Covid-19 pandemic disrupts almost all industries, enterprises
                  face an imperative to transform even faster - as fast as 3 to
                  6 months allocated for every project. This guide suggests
                  where and how can companies focus to enhance their chances of
                  successful digital transformations
                </p>

                <h3>The Covid-19 pandemic and the associated imperative</h3>

                <p>
                  The Covid-19 crisis suddenly provides a glimpse into the
                  future of digital and casts a somber spotlight on the urgent
                  need for businesses to build digital capabilities and become
                  resilient. More than ever, companies must be able to respond
                  to dramatic changes across 3 important pillars of business:
                  supply chains, customer expectations, and workforce needs.
                  There are good starts. However, business leaders are realizing
                  that it’s crunch time to scale digital transformations rapidly
                  and prepare for the new normal
                </p>

                <p>
                  For instance, an e-commerce company had to enable truly
                  real-time transactions as a result of the growing demand
                  during the crisis. However, the solution wasn’t alone about
                  changing the core banking system merchants. It was more than
                  that. The company had to first transform from a monolithic to
                  a microservices architecture that made its development teams
                  more nimble. As a result, the company was able to go to the
                  market 1.8x times faster than any other competitor.
                </p>

                <h3>New digital capabilities to pursue in changing times</h3>

                <p>
                  It wasn’t all belt-tightening before the Covid-19 pandemic
                  struck. However, strange as it may seem, right now, companies
                  must take on bold digital initiatives that they have hesitated
                  to pursue in the past. In order to decide on the new digital
                  capabilities required to coordinate the Covid-19 crisis
                  response, businesses must stay close to evolving customer
                  needs and market changes. In the immediate effect, for
                  example, businesses are looking for virtual replacements for
                  their brick and mortar stores. But such a transformation is
                  usually backed by a holistic platform that hosts innumerable
                  digital capabilities. And this is about how, exactly,
                  companies should adopt new technologies that will help pave
                  successful digital transformations during the Covid-19 crisis.

                <h3>Cloud migration</h3>
                <p>

                    alt="cloud migration.png"
                  />
                </p>
                <p>
                  Covid-19 war rooms of companies would benefit from
                  technologies that increase their responsiveness to shifting
                  customer and market demands. When it is about accessing the
                  critical tools and applications that ignite enterprise
                  operations, remote access is on the top of the list. Companies
                  must choose to migrate their functional workloads to the
                  cloud. This can be done by a deep assessment based on the
                  dependency of the supporting applications. In many cases,
                  companies must navigate the right resources by striking a
                  balance between public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud
                  environments. In our experience, companies with a multi-cloud
                  configuration recovered faster than any other during the
                  Covid-19 crisis.
                </p>

                <h3>Mobile internet technologies</h3>

                <p>
                  In order to achieve the right set of digital capabilities to
                  deliver on customer needs, companies must go beyond their
                  comfort zones and take an end-to-end view of how end-users
                  interact with their businesses. Even though the resources for
                  digital transformation are necessarily limited, companies are
                  strongly recommended to adopt mobile internet technologies
                  across the most critical operational ends. Customer
                  experience, in our analysis, is one of the important starting
                  points. One European consumer banking platform, for example,
                  established a fully functional mobile app in just three
                  months. The lightweight application connected its marketing
                  and customer support, and reduced friction for accelerated
                  digital transformations.
                </p>

                <h3>Big data, AI and advanced analytics</h3>
                <p>
                  <img
                    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/zyclyxweb/image/upload/v1605769895/big_data_AI_and_advanced_analytics_30e97909c0.png"
                    alt="big data, AI and advanced analytics.png"
                  />
                </p>
                <p>
                  This isn’t a secret recipe. Companies blending human and
                  digital capabilities have been usually seen to achieve
                  superior outcomes. And data is the bridge. With the right
                  data, companies have better visibility into various business
                  levers and can make rapid changes that situations demand. Most
                  digital transformations during the Covid-19 crisis are
                  spearheaded by the support of advanced analytics capabilities.
                  In order to add a concrete pulley to activate the right data
                  sets for the right situations, artificial intelligence is of
                  utmost importance. The rapid adoption of these technologies
                  during the Covid-19 pandemic may not look like transformation
                  as usual - but the crisis hasn’t left an easy bonus on
                  businesses as usual, either.
                </p>

                <h3>Robotics process automation</h3>
                <p>
                  During times like these, lower priority projects can be put on
                  the back burner. However, on the other hand, it’s more
                  important than ever to pursue a few projects at an urgency
                  that can’t be easily defined. Leading firms must consider
                  accelerating automation efforts in such areas that deserve
                  attention. For example, the BFSI industry must focus on data
                  management and customer support functions for automation
                  projects. In another case, businesses emerging from supply
                  chain changes in the retail sector must lay their attention on
                  new avenues of customer channels both on the digital and
                  physical fronts. As one executive put it, “We knew that it was
                  coming and had our machines ready. But we couldn’t afford the
                  pace at which the crisis struck as a few parts could have been
                  automated.”
                </p>
                <h3>Future proof the IT function for absolute resiliency</h3>
                <p>
                  One successful company, during the Covid-19 crisis, took the
                  time to reskill its middle management in the IT function while
                  adding the required digital capabilities to its portfolio.
                  Such a unified approach not only helped the company recover
                  quicker, but also take a trajectory towards motivated digital
                  transformations based on sparks of innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The context is simple. It is the persistence and
                  result-oriented philosophy of IT teams that make a successful
                  digital transformation during a crisis like Covid-19. Frequent
                  reviews, talent retention programs, and periodic reviews are
                  some of the definite success factors that distinguish leaders
                  from laggards. But pragmatism, collaboration, critical
                  thinking, and agility are equally important for a resilient IT
                  function. Some tools and technologies that companies can look
                  up to are workforce mobility, central ERP, and emotional
                  intelligence platforms.

                  A large airline understood this when the bad times became
                  evident as a result of the pandemic. To get started, the
                  company hired a transformation program manager that settled
                  the right actions required to jumpstart right after the
                  restrictions were up. Today, the company has deployed a
                  large-scale IoT project which enables complete touchless
                  arrival and departure of its passengers.

                    With the right digital capabilities, businesses can take the
                    Covid-19 crisis as an opportunity to build for the future.
                    But businesses that take proactive steps in the above areas
                    of digital transformation can increase their organization’s
                    efficiency and resilience.
